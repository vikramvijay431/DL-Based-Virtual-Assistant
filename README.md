# Virtual Assistant
It is a virtual assistant for visually impaired which include models like face recognition, object detection, text to speech, speech recognition. The idea behind this project is to host this website and use it from mobile phones and therefore the website's UI is designed according to mobile phones.

Key Features:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes advanced NLP models to understand and interpret user queries.
Speech Recognition and Response: Integrates speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities for seamless communication.
Task Automation: Automates various tasks, including setting reminders, opening applications, sending emails, and retrieving information.
Deep Learning Models: Incorporates deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for language understanding and context retention.
API Integration: Connects with third-party APIs (e.g., weather, news, email) for fetching real-time information.
Voice Interaction: Provides real-time voice interaction with personalized responses.
Customizable Modules: Users can add or modify specific commands based on their needs.
